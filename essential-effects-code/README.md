# Essential Effects Code

This repository contains exercises and solutions for
[Inner Product's Essential Effects][course] training course.

If you want to discuss the content or exercises with the authors,
drop us an [email][email].

## Using the Source Code

This repository contains two branches: one for `exercises` and one for `solutions`.
The directory structure is the same in each branch.

You will need to have Git, the JDK, and an internet connection to run the exercises.
All other dependencies are either included with the repo
or downloaded on demand during compilation.

## Notes on Editors and IDEs

If you don't have a particular preference for a Scala editor or IDE,
we recommend you do the exercises for this course using
the [Visual Studio Code][vscode] editor with the [Metals][metals] and [Scala syntax][scala-syntax] extensions.

If you want to use IntelliJ we suggest installing it via the [Scala Bundle][intellij-scala-bundle],
which includes all the plugins you need for Scala development.
